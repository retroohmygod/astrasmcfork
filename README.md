# Hi!

This is a fork of [SmartCMD's LCE Repo](https://github.com/smartcmd/MinecraftConsoles) with some custom things.
I've removed anything I don't find important from the README. So everything here I believe is what should be needed to use the fork properly.
## Multiplayer

Basic LAN multiplayer is available on the Windows build

- Hosting a multiplayer world automatically advertises it on the local network
- Other players on the same LAN can discover the session from the in-game Join Game menu
- Game connections use TCP port `25565` by default
- LAN discovery uses UDP port `25566`
- Add servers to your server list with `servers.txt` (temp solution)
- Rename yourself without losing data by keeping your `uid.dat`

Parts of this feature are based on code from [LCEMP](https://github.com/LCEMP/LCEMP) (thanks!)

### servers.txt

To add a server to your game, create the `servers.txt` file in the same directory as you have `Minecraft.Client.exe`. Inside, follow this format:
```
serverip.example.com
25565
The name of your server in UI!
```

For example, here's a valid servers.txt
```
1.1.1.1
25565
Cloudflare's Very Own LCE Server
127.0.0.1
25565
Localhost Test Crap
```

### Launch Arguments

| Argument           | Description                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-name <username>` | Sets your in-game username.                                                                         |
| `-fullscreen`      | Launches the game in Fullscreen mode                                                                |

Example:
```
Minecraft.Client.exe -name Steve -fullscreen
```

The headless server also reads and writes `server.properties` in the working directory. If `-ip` / `-port` are omitted in `-server` mode, it falls back to `server-ip` / `server-port` from that file. Dedicated-server host options such as `trust-players`, `pvp`, `fire-spreads`, `tnt`, `difficulty`, `gamemode`, `spawn-animals`, and `spawn-npcs` are persisted there as well.

## Build & Run

1. Install Visual Studio 2022
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project by double-clicking `MinecraftConsoles.sln`
4. Make sure `Minecraft.Client` is set as the Startup Project
5. Set the build configuration to **Debug** (Release is also OK but has some bugs) and the target platform to **Windows64**, then build and run

### CMake (Windows x64)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Debug --target MinecraftClient
```

For more information, see [COMPILE.md](COMPILE.md)

## Known Issues

- Native builds for platforms other than Windows have not been tested and are most likely non-functional. The Windows nightly build may still run on macOS and Linux through Wine or CrossOver, but that path is unofficial and not currently supported
